Built in Ruby 2.6.5

The entire repo here is not needed- only the fish.rb file is.

Ruby/Rails framework is for a later plan to build a front end which displays the internal machinations as the puzzle is being solved.

Below is the original puzzle from Coudal's site:

https://www.coudal.com/thefish.php

There are five houses in a row in different colors. In each house lives a person with a different nationality. The five owners drink a different drink, smoke a different brand of cigar and keep a different pet, one of which is a Walleye Pike.
